      <h2>About Company Page</h2>
      <h4>Precision Development has a proven track record on projects such as residential housing,
      multi-story building, retail, office, hospitality/resort, and warehouse space.</h4> 
      <p>From financing and plan development, thru project completion and customer care, we are able
      to assist our clients thru the entire process.</p>
      <p>Precision Development was started in 1997 in Cedar City, Utah.  Its founder and President, 
      Dennis M. Gray, has been involved in the construction industry since 1987. He is licensed as a 
      general contractor in Utah, Alaska, California, and soon to be Arizona.  During his career he 
      has built close to 1,000 homes and has constructed over 40 separate commercial projects. He is 
      an expert in leadership. He has served in various capacities in the local community; some of 
      which include a water board president, Board of Directors member for the Iron County Board of 
      Realtors and even as a past president of the Iron County Home Builders Association.</p>
      <p>Superintendent, Tim R. Tasker, graduated from SUU with his Associate of Science. He also 
      earned his EMT certificate from the State of Utah before joining Precision Development in 2008.  
      Tim's expertise is in running projects.  He has expert knowledge in the bidding and subcontractor 
      management phases of construction. Tim's love for learning has lead him to get his general 
      contractor license in the State of Utah. He has also earned his Lead-Based Paint Renovator 
      Certification from the Utah Division of Air Quality.</p>
      <p>Precision Development has rooted its family ties into the Southern Utah area and plans to be

      the Iron County Home Builders Association.</p>
